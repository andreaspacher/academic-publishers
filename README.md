# academic-publishers
A list of academic publishers and their scholarly journals.

The compilation of the list is generated by webscraping the following four sources:

* DOAJ
* Publons
* Scopus
* Sherpa Romeo

(The webscraping occurs in the files 01 to 04 in the `Script`-folder.)

Then the journal counts of each publisher thus scraped are compared in a way that the highest journal count per publisher prevails (this is done in file 05 in the `Script`-folder). And the script then orders the publishers by that respective highest journal count.

In a further step, harmonizes duplicated names of publishers (based on the data in `Data\03_publishers_harmonization.txt`). 

The full (harmonized) list of the publishers and their journal counts is visible in `Output\allpublishers.xlsx`.

Finally, the publishers' websites are scraped so as to extract all of their journals, including the URL to each journal (in file 06 in the `Script`-folder). To do so, the script uses css selectors as identified for each publisher in `Data\publishers.csv`.

The outcome of this will be uploaded to `Output\alljournals.csv` soon.
