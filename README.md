# academic-publishers
A list of academic publishers and their scholarly journals.

The compilation of the list is generated by webscraping the following four sources:

* DOAJ
* Publons
* Scopus
* Sherpa Romeo

(The webscraping occurs in the files 01 to 04 in the `Script`-folder.)

In file 05, the journal counts of each publisher thus scraped are then compared in a way that the highest journal count per publisher prevails; and the script then orders the publishers by that respective highest journal count.

In addition, it harmonizes duplicated names of publishers (based on the data in `Data\03_publishers_harmonization.txt`). 

Finally, the publishers' websites are scraped so as to identify all of their journals, including the URL to each journal (in file 06 in the `Script`-folder). To do so, it uses the css selectors as identified for each publisher in `Data\publishers.xlsx`.
